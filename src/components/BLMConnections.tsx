            <p>
              Black Lives Matter in the UK continues earlier struggles against racism and colonialism. 
              By addressing both historical wrongs and today's problems, BLM UK pushes Britain to face its 
              past honestly and build fairer systems for everyone. This link between past and present makes 
              BLM especially important in Britain, where empire's shadow still affects how society works.
