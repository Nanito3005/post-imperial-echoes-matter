            <p>
              The Black Lives Matter movement in Britain continues earlier anti-colonial and 
              anti-racist struggles. By addressing both historical wrongs and current problems, 
              BLM UK challenges Britain to face its imperial past and build fairer systems for the future. 
              This link between past and present makes BLM especially important in Britain, 
              where the legacy of empire still shapes society and attitudes.
