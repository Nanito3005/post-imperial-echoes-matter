              Britain once ruled over a huge empire. Even though that empire is gone now, its effects 
              are still felt today. This affects how people in Britain think about race, identity, and who 
              "belongs" in Britain.

              This website looks at how Britain's past connects to movements like Black Lives Matter today.
